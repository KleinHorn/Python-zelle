## Review Questions

## True / False

1. Computer science is the study of computers
    - False. Computer science is the study of what can be computed.
2. The CPU is the "brain" of the computer
    - True
3. Secondary memory is also called RAM
    - False. Secondary memory would be some form of non-volatile memory.
4. All information that a computer is currently working on is stored in main memory.
    - True.
5. The syntax of a language is it's meaning, and semantics is it's form.
    - False. Semantics are meaning, syntax is form.
6. A function definition is a sequence of statements that defines a new command.
    - True
7. A programming environment refers to a place where programmers work.
    - False. Programming environment refers to the toolkit that a programmer uses to program. It could be as complicated as an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or as simple as a text editor.
8. A variable is used to give a name to a value so it can be referred to in other places.
    - True.
9. A loop is used to skip over a section of a program.
    - False. A loop is used to run a section of a program multiple times.
10. A chaotic function can't be computed by a computer.
    - False. Computers compute chaotic functions every day.

## Multiple Choice

1. What is the fundamental question of computer science?
    - (B) What can be computed?
2. An algorithm is like a
    - (D) Recipe
3. A problem is intractable when
    - (D) it is not practical to solve
4. Which of the following is _not_ an example of secondary memory?
    - (A) RAM
5. Computer languages designed to be used and understood by humans are
    - (B) High-level computer languages
6. A statement is
    - (B) a complete computer command
7. One difference between a compiler and an interpreter is
    - (B) a compiler is used to translate high-level language into machine language
8. By convention, the statements of a program are often placed in a function called
    - (B) main
9. Which of the following is _not_ true of comments?
    - (A) They make a program more efficient
10. The items listen in the parentheses of a function definition are called
    - (D) parameters

## Discussion

1. Compare and contrast the following pairs of concepts from the chapter
    1. Hardware vs. Software
        - Hardware refers to everything that is physical in a computer: copper, transistors, capacitors, ram, cpu. Software refers to the instructions that are being given to the hardware.
    2. Algorithm vs. program
        - An algorithm is a recipe for solving a mathematical problem. A precise step-by-step plan for solving a mathematical problem. A program is a set of instructions that are given to a computer to carry out.
    3. Programming Language vs. Natural Language
        - Programming languages have precise semantics and syntax. Natural language does not and can be interpreted differently depending on the situation.
    4. High-Level Language vs. Machine Language
        - High level languages are more like natural language in that they can be understood by humans. Machine languages are cryptic in nature and typically written in hex or binary.
    5. Interpreter vs. Compiler
        - An interpreter turns high level language into machine code line by line as the program is running. A compiler turns high-level languages into a file containing machine code that can be ran at a future time.
    6. Syntax vs. Semantics
        - Syntax is the grammar of a language: Where does a comma go? Do I need to indent here? Full stop? Semantics are the meaning of language, reign vs rain.
